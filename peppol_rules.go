// This file evaluates the OpenPEPPOL rule set — the PEPPOL-COMMON-* and
// PEPPOL-EN16931-* identifiers of testdata/peppol/repo/rules/sch — against the
// parsed document tree, one binding at a time.
//
// # Why the tree and not the model
//
// peppol.go evaluates the handful of Peppol rules that are statements about
// business terms on the syntax-neutral model, which is where every BR-* rule in
// this package lives. Most of Peppol's rules are not that. "A document MUST NOT
// contain empty elements", "only one cac:TaxTotal may carry cac:TaxSubtotal",
// "every @currencyID must equal BT-5", "an identifier declared under scheme 0192
// must pass the Norwegian mod-11 check" are statements about an XML tree and about
// attributes the model does not carry, and half of them are published in one
// binding only. en16931_ubl_rules.go makes the same argument at greater length.
//
// # Two bindings that are not translations of each other
//
// The UBL file publishes 58 identifiers and the CII file 44, and the union is 59 —
// so a rule present in one binding must not fire on a document written in the
// other. PEPPOL-EN16931-R006 exists only in CII; CL006, P0101, P0104..P0111,
// P0112, R008, R044, R046 and R051 exist only in UBL. Where an identifier is in
// both, its XPath can still test a different thing: R002 exempts a German
// invoice from the one-note limit in UBL and instead forbids a note subject code
// in CII, R053 counts cac:TaxTotal groups in UBL and ram:TaxTotalAmount elements
// in CII, and R121's context is the line in UBL and the price in CII. Each rule
// below cites the XPath it was transcribed from, per binding, and peppolRules is
// the table that says which binding publishes what — checked against the artefact
// by TestPeppolRuleTableMatchesTheSchematron, in both directions.
//
// This is the shape of the defect PRs 13 and 14 established the pattern for and
// this rule set had anyway: PEPPOL-EN16931-P0104..P0111 were evaluated on the
// shared model and therefore reported for CII documents, where OpenPEPPOL
// publishes no such rule. Eight identifiers were being reported against an
// authority that does not define them for that syntax.
//
// # The same rules, as XRechnung imports them
//
// KoSIT's released XRechnung Schematron merges 21 of these rules in at build time,
// driven by the whitelist in testdata/xrechnung/schematron/src/xsl/rule-list.xml
// and the stylesheet src/xsl/peppol-into-xr.xsl. The merge is not a copy, and the
// differences are load-bearing, so the same rule bodies are used for both paths
// with a dialect flag rather than being written twice:
//
//   - only the 21 whitelisted identifiers are merged, so an XRechnung validation
//     must not acquire the other 38 (peppolXRImports);
//   - the stylesheet *adds* R008, R044 and R046 to the CII binding, which
//     OpenPEPPOL's own CII file does not publish, with CII XPaths of KoSIT's own
//     writing (peppolXRCIIAdditions);
//   - it rewrites the CII wording of R053 from "= 1" to "<= 1" and of R055 to
//     tolerate an absent BT-110;
//   - it replaces the 0.02 tolerance of R040 and R120 with $slackValue, which is
//     0.5 when BT-5 is HUF;
//   - and it re-flags R120 as warning where OpenPEPPOL flags it fatal.
//
// That last one is C29's shape exactly, in a rule set nobody had compared: the
// artefact a German buyer validates against reports a line-net-amount mismatch as
// a warning, so reporting it fatal on the XRechnung path would refuse an invoice
// KoSIT accepts. The flag a finding carries is therefore read from the artefact
// the run is quoting — peppolFlags for a Peppol validation, peppolXRFlags layered
// over it for an XRechnung one — and TestPeppolSeveritiesQuoteTheArtefacts checks
// both against the files.

// peppolBindings is the set of syntax bindings that publish a rule.
