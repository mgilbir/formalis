package formalis

// Coverage: what this package checked, and what it did not.
//
// # Why a validator has to say what it did not check
//
// This package already draws one epistemic line with unusual care. limits.go
// spends eighty lines arguing that "the checker stopped" must never look like
// "the invoice is clean", and it backs the argument with RuleLimit,
// IsCheckerViolation and tests that pin the property. But there is a third
// state, and until this file existed it was folded into "clean": *the checks
// that exist all passed, and the rule set they come from is a documented
// subset*.
//
// Every rule set in this package is such a subset. Four CIUS say so in a file
// comment; the twelve national formats check "the mandatory structure and code
// lists" rather than the XSD or Schematron their authority publishes; and the
// EN 16931 core itself — the one rule set that looked complete, because the
// CEN unit-test oracle reports 198/198 — implemented, when this table was
// written, none of the CII datatype bindings and five of the fifty-four fatal
// UBL syntax rules. None of that reached a caller. Both bindings' fatal halves
// are evaluated now, and the table below is how that became a statement someone
// can check rather than a claim in a commit message. A Portuguese integrator
// could run ValidateCIUSPT, read
// len(v) == 0, file with AT, and be rejected on BR-CIUS-PT-13: a rule this
// package never evaluated and never said it had not evaluated.
//
// The consequence of confusing "unknown" with "clean" is the same in both
// cases — an invoice ships that should not have — so the two belong behind one
// question. Report.Complete is that question and Report.Conformant is the
// single predicate a caller can safely key on: it is false for a run that
// stopped early *and* for a run whose rule set has holes an authority would
// reject an invoice over.
//
// The severity on each family is what keeps the second half usable. A rule set
// with no fatal gaps left can be conformant while still not complete, so
// implementing an authority's advisory tier improves the report without being
// the price of a verdict, and a fatal gap can never be filed inside an entry
// whose prose reads as advisory — which had already happened once (C27).
//
// The evaluability of each family is what keeps it *answerable*. An authority can
// publish a rule its own reference implementation cannot honour, and CEN publishes
// seven; a table that could only say "not evaluated" about those made the strict
// question permanently unanswerable, for a reason no work could change. Saying so
// in a field of its own is what lets one rule set here finally report that it saw
// everything a reference validator could. See RuleFamily.Unevaluable, and read its
// boundary carefully: it is the field that would do the most damage if it widened.
//
// # Why the table is static
//
// Coverage takes a Source and reads a table. It parses nothing, allocates one
// copy of a slice of constants, and cannot fail, because what a rule set omits
// is a property of this package rather than of any document. That is what lets
// a caller ask the question *before* deciding to trust an answer, and it is
// what lets the table be the single source of truth: newReport builds
// Report.NotEvaluated from it, so the strings a caller reads are the strings
// the table holds and there is no second list to drift.
//
// # Why Source and not CIUS
//
// The obvious key is CIUS, since the CIUS validators are where the problem was
// first noticed. It does not work: CIUS names seven rule sets, and the thirteen
// tree-reading validators (FatturaPA, Facturae, ebInterface, KSeF, Finvoice,
// TEAPPS, OIOUBL, Svefaktura, ZATCA, NAV OSA, UBL-TR, PINT, Order-X) are not
// CIUS and are the *most* partial rule sets in the package — CIUS would have
// left every one of them unable to declare its coverage. Source already names
// every rule-authoring authority here, the seven CIUS among them, so it is the
// key that makes the table total.

// RuleFamily names a group of rules an authority publishes and this package does
// not evaluate, in a form a caller can look up in that authority's own
// documentation.
//
// # Three facts, three fields
//
// A gap has three independent properties, and the type carries one field for
// each because collapsing any two of them has already gone wrong here.
//
// Severity is the authority's published flag, quoted, unconditionally. It is not
// this package's estimate of what the gap costs. Every entry in the table can be
// checked against the artefact its authority publishes wherever this repository
// vendors one, and TestCoverageSeveritiesMatchThePublishedFlag does exactly that
// with no exceptions at all.
//
// Unevaluable is whether the authority published a rule *nobody* can evaluate —
// see the field's own comment, which is where the boundary is drawn, because it
// is the field most likely to be abused.
//
// Reason is the prose, and for an unevaluable family it is where the evidence
// goes.
//
// # Why they cannot be collapsed
//
// Severity and Unevaluable were one column until D10. To keep Report.Conformant
// from being false forever over rules CEN itself cannot honour, six entries CEN
// flags fatal were recorded at SeverityWarning, and the contradiction was kept
// legal by a hand-maintained list of those six identifiers inside the test that
// checks the column against the published flag. A column that needs an excuse
// list is answering two questions, and the excuse list is the load-bearing part:
// it had to be edited by hand every time such a rule was found, which is the
// same failure mode as a coverage claim in a file comment.
//
// The cost of that collapse was not only tidiness. Report.Complete could never
// be true for any document, because CEN publishes seven rules nobody can
// evaluate and the table could not say so in a form a predicate could read — so
// the question "did this package see everything a reference validator would"
// had a permanent answer of no, for a reason a caller could not tell apart from
// "not implemented yet". That is the trap Conformant was in before severity
// arrived, one level down.
//
// A third Severity value was rejected rather than overlooked. Unevaluability is
// orthogonal to severity, not a further point on the same scale, and Severity's
// own comment argues against a third value for a reason that applies here too:
// it would stop Report.Fatal and Report.Warnings being a partition of
// Violations.
type RuleFamily struct {
	// Rules is the identifier or range the authority uses — "BR-DE-23-a/b,
	// BR-DE-24-a/b", "BR-CIUS-PT-24..63", "BR-NL-19..35". It is the machine-ish
	// half, written the way the authority writes it, ranges included, so that the
	// tests holding this table to the published Schematron can read identifiers
	// out of it and a caller can search for one.
	Rules string

	// Severity is the flag the authority put on these rules: fatal when it
	// rejects a document for breaking one, warning when it does not. It is a
	// quotation and never an estimate — not of how much the gap matters, and not
	// of what it costs a verdict. Where the authority publishes no flag because it
	// publishes no rule identifier (a format checked against its own schema), the
	// severity is this package's classification for the reason Severity documents.
	Severity Severity

	// Unevaluable reports that the authority published these rules and no
	// validator can evaluate them — the authority's own reference implementation
	// included. It is a fact about the published artefact, not about this package,
	// and it is what lets Report.Complete be reachable: a rule nobody can check is
	// not a rule this package skipped.
	//
	// It is deliberately narrow, and the narrowness is the point. It means the
	// artefact makes the rule unreachable or vacuous, demonstrably, from the
	// artefact itself: CEN binds BR-CO-05..08 to the XPath expression true(), so
	// the assertion cannot fail; CEN's ISO Schematron gives a node to the first
	// matching rule in a pattern and //ram:TypeCode precedes the rule
	// CII-DT-010/011/012 are bound to, so no processor reaches them; CEN's UBL
	// test for BR-51 is a string-length bound that a correctly masked card number
	// trips, so honouring it would mean accusing conforming invoices. Each of
	// those is checkable against a file in this repository by a reviewer who
	// disagrees, and Reason has to say which file and which construct.
	//
	// It does not mean hard, expensive, low-value, out of scope, or not yet. A
	// rule this package could implement and has not is a gap with Unevaluable
	// false, whatever the excuse — including the four CIUS whose authority
	// publishes no Schematron this repository vendors, which are unimplemented and
	// not unevaluable. TestUnevaluableFamiliesNameTheirEvidence and
	// TestOnlyEN16931HasUnevaluableFamilies keep that boundary from eroding as
	// later work adds entries, because a field that quietly widens to "we did not
	// do this one" would make Complete a lie in exactly the way the old Complete
	// field was.
	Unevaluable bool

	// Reason is why it is not evaluated, in prose. It is where a judgement gets
	// written down — that a rule is unenforceable by construction, that a
	// sub-profile is out of scope, that an authority publishes a schema rather
	// than a rule set — and for an Unevaluable family it is where the evidence
	// goes, specific enough to check against the vendored artefact without
	// re-deriving it.
	Reason string
}

// Report is the outcome of one validation: what the checker found, and whether
// it was in a position to find everything.
//
// The second half is the point. A bare []Violation can say "here is what is
// wrong" and "here is nothing", and a caller reasonably reads the second as
// "this invoice is fine" — but "nothing" is produced by four quite different
// runs: one that checked everything and found nothing; one that was cancelled;
// one that hit a resource budget; and one that ran a rule set which does not
// implement every rule its authority publishes. Complete separates the first
// from the other three, and Conformant is the predicate that gets it right.
//
// The zero Report is deliberately neither Conformant nor Complete, so a Report
// that was never filled in — a var nobody assigned, a struct decoded from JSON
// that had no such field, the value returned alongside an error a caller chose
// to ignore — cannot pass for a clean invoice. The unexported ran field is what
// holds that: see its comment, because the guard is easy to lose.
type Report struct {
	// Violations is every finding: the ways the document departs from the rules
	// that were evaluated, plus any statement by this checker about its own run
	// (RuleLimit, RuleProfile — see IsCheckerViolation) or about the file it was
	// handed (RuleRoot).
	Violations []Violation

	// NotEvaluated names the rule families the rule set that ran does not
	// implement. A validator that composes rule sets reports the union:
	// ValidateCIUSPT runs the EN 16931 core and the CIUS-PT rules, so its
	// NotEvaluated holds both sources' gaps.
	//
	// It is empty when no rule set was selected — an unknown Profile — because
	// naming the gaps of a rule set that was never chosen would say something
	// about the document, and nothing was checked. Complete is false there too,
	// through the RuleProfile finding.
	NotEvaluated []RuleFamily

	// It exists for one reason, and the reason is not obvious enough to leave

	// so a Report with no findings and no gaps answers true to both — and the
	// zero Report is exactly that. Every earlier shape of this type made the
	// zero value non-conformant (a Complete field defaulting to false did it for
	// free), and the contract that a Report nobody filled in cannot read as a
	// clean invoice is load-bearing: it is what makes it safe for a caller to
	// ignore an error return, decode a Report from a wire format, or copy one
	// out of a zero-valued struct field. newReport is the only thing that sets
	// this, so every one of those paths yields false and TestZeroReportIsNotConformant
	// and TestReportFromAnIgnoredErrorIsNotConformant pin both directions.
	ran bool
}

// Conformant reports whether this document may be treated as conforming to the
// rule set it was validated against.
//
// It is the conjunction the caller almost always means: nothing found that an
// authority rejects a document for, and nothing left unexamined that could have
// been. len(Violations) == 0 alone is the claim this package exists to stop
// people making, because it is equally true of a run that checked everything, a
// run that was cancelled, and a run whose rule set has fatal holes.
//
// Three things make it false:
//
//   - a fatal finding — the document breaks a rule its authority rejects for;
//   - a finding IsCheckerViolation recognises — the run was cut short, or never
//     chose a rule set, so the answer is "unknown" rather than "conformant";
//   - a fatal family in NotEvaluated that is evaluable — a rule that could have
//     rejected this document, that a validator could have checked, and that this
//     package did not check.
//
// Warnings do not: an advisory finding, and an advisory gap in the rule set, are
// both things a reference validator would report and no authority would reject
// an invoice for. Read them with Warnings and Complete respectively.
//
// Nor does a fatal family its authority made unevaluable, and that exception is
// narrower than it sounds. It is not "we decided this one does not count": it
// means the published artefact cannot fail — CEN binds four of these to the XPath
// expression true() — or cannot be reached, so no validator anywhere reports it
// and no gateway rejects a document over it. Not checking a rule nothing can
// check cannot put a verdict in doubt. RuleFamily.Unevaluable is where the
// boundary is documented and two tests hold the table to it.
//
// The checker's own findings are tested for by IsCheckerViolation and not merely
// by their severity, deliberately. They are fatal — see Severity — but a
// stopped run must be non-conformant because the checker did not look, which is
// a different fact from the finding's weight, and this predicate should not
// quietly start depending on a severity someone could reclassify.
//
// A consequence worth stating plainly: every rule set in this package has gaps
// today, and a rule set with a *fatal* gap makes Conformant false for every
// document it validates, however clean. One rule set no longer has one. The EN
// 16931 core's fatal half is complete — every fatal rule of the semantic model,
// of the UBL binding and of the CII binding is evaluated, bar the handful CEN's
// own reference implementation cannot report — so a clean invoice validated
// against the core alone, by Validate with ProfileEN16931 or by ValidateCIUS on a
// document declaring no CIUS, is conformant — and Complete as well, which no rule
// set in this package had ever been: everything left in Coverage(SourceEN16931) is
// a rule CEN itself cannot honour. Every other Source still names a fatal gap it
// could close and has not, so Conformant is still false for every document a CIUS
// or national validator is handed.
// Coverage says why for any Source, and Report.NotEvaluated says why for any
// particular run. A caller who wants the older, weaker claim writes
// len(r.Fatal()) == 0 and now has r.NotEvaluated sitting beside it, naming
// exactly what that claim omits.

// Complete reports whether every rule that *can* be evaluated was evaluated,

//
//   - the rule set that ran does not implement some family its authority
//     publishes and a validator could check, which is a static fact about this
//     package and is named in NotEvaluated, whatever that family's severity; or
//   - this run stopped before it had seen everything — a cancelled context or a
//     tripped resource budget — or never chose a rule set at all, which
//     Violations reports as a finding IsCheckerViolation recognises.
//
// It was a field until severity arrived and is a method now, because with
// severity on the family the two questions genuinely differ: Conformant asks
// whether the verdict is trustworthy and passes over advisory gaps, Complete
// asks whether this package saw as much as a reference validator would. A single
// boolean could answer only one of them, and it answered the stricter one, which
// is why a residue of advisory families would have kept Conformant false forever.
//
// A family its authority made unevaluable does not make a run incomplete, and
// that clause is what makes this predicate answerable at all. Without it the
// question is "did this package evaluate every rule its authorities published",
// and for CEN the answer is permanently no — not because of anything this package
// could fix, but because CEN publishes seven rules it cannot honour itself, four
// of them bound to the XPath expression true(). A predicate whose answer no work
// can change tells a caller nothing, which is the state Conformant was in before
// severity moved onto the family. With the clause the question becomes "did this
// package see everything a reference validator could see", which is answerable,
// and as of the advisory bindings the EN 16931 core answers yes. See
// RuleFamily.Unevaluable for why that clause cannot be stretched.

//
// The entries are derived from what the code emits, not from what the file
// comments claim. Three tests hold them to that:
// TestCoverageNamesNoRuleThePackageEmits sweeps the corpus and fails if an entry
// claims a rule that a validator does in fact report;
// TestEN16931CoverageNamesRulesCENPublishes checks every identifier under
// SourceEN16931 against the vendored CEN Schematron so the table cannot invent
// a rule family; and TestCoverageSeveritiesMatchThePublishedFlag checks the
// severity of every entry whose authority ships a Schematron this repository
// vendors — EN 16931, XRechnung and Peppol — against the flag on the assertion
// itself, with no exceptions. Two more hold RuleFamily.Unevaluable to its
// definition: TestUnevaluableFamiliesNameTheirEvidence and
// TestOnlyEN16931HasUnevaluableFamilies.
//
// Two writing conventions, which those tests read:
//
//   - The Rules field is the claim and the Reason field is prose. Both are read
//     by both guards, so moving a claim into the prose cannot dodge either; what
//     the split buys is that the severity and the identifiers sit where a caller
//     can use them without parsing a sentence.
//
//   - An entry that carves out the implemented part of a family says "other
//     than", "emits only" or "binding only" in Rules and then lists it. Those
//     three phrases mark the *entry* as containing identifiers this package does
//     report, so the over-claim test skips both its fields — a Reason that
//     explains such a carve-out has to be able to name the evaluated half (BR-51
//     in the CII binding is the example). Any other phrasing is taken as a plain
//     claim that everything the entry names is unevaluated.
//
//     "binding only" is the third of them and the newest. It is what an entry says
//     when a rule is evaluable in one of an authority's syntax bindings and not in
//     the other, which NLCIUS is the first rule set here to have: SI-UBL's BR-NL-9
//     is reached and NLCIUS-CII's copy of it is not, so the identifier is both
//     evaluated and named as a gap, and the entry has to be able to say which is
//     which.
//
// A family whose members do not share one flag is split into one entry per
// severity rather than recorded at the stronger of the two. That is not
// cosmetic: the two fatal UBL-CR rules sat inside an entry describing 678 rules
// as "all but two advisory" (C27), where a fatal gap was accounted for in a line
// a reader would skim as advisory, and four XRechnung provisional rules were
// filed together as "provisional/advisory" when KoSIT flags two of them fatal.
// Splitting is how the severity column stays a fact rather than a rounding.
//
// A Source absent from the map is claimed complete. Only SourceChecker is,
// today, and it is absent because it publishes no rules rather than because it
// implements all of them.
var notEvaluated = map[Source][]RuleFamily{
	// EN 16931 is the rule set that most looked complete and is not. The CEN
	// unit-test suite has error fragments for 198 rules and this package catches

	// semantic model and eight of the syntax bindings; it says nothing about the
	// remaining bindings, and it has no error fragment at all for thirty model
	// rules. Reading the published Schematron instead of the oracle gives the
	// list below.
	//
	// All three entries below are Unevaluable, and the reason each gives is meant
	// to be checked rather than believed. BR-CO-05..08 are bound to true();
	// CII-DT-010/011/012 sit behind an earlier matching rule in the same ISO
	// Schematron pattern; BR-51's UBL binding is a string-length bound a correctly
	// masked card number exceeds. Each names the vendored file.
	//
	// No fatal gap is left here that a validator could close, and this is the only
	// Source of which that is true. All 54 fatal UBL-SR-* rules are evaluated, and so are the two
	// fatal UBL-CR-* rules and the three fatal UBL-DT-* ones
	// (en16931_ubl_rules.go, en16931_model.go); so are all 42 fatal CII-SR-* and
	// 67 of the 70 fatal CII-DT-* rules (en16931_cii_rules.go).
	//
	// The advisory halves of both bindings are evaluated too, as of the generated
	// tables in en16931_syntax_advisory.go: 676 UBL-CR-*, 21 UBL-DT-*, 440
	// CII-SR-* and 31 CII-DT-* rules, reported at SeverityWarning. They used to be
	// four entries in this table. They are gone from it because they are checked,
	// not because they were reclassified.
	//
	// What is left is three entries covering seven rules, and every one of them is
	// a rule CEN published that no validator can evaluate. Each carries
	// Unevaluable, each names the file and the construct that makes it so, and
	// each carries the flag CEN actually published rather than the flag that would
	// keep a predicate quiet — which is the whole of D10. Six of the seven were
	// recorded here at SeverityWarning against a published flag of fatal, and the
	// contradiction was held open by a list of those six identifiers inside the
	// test that checks this column. That list is gone.
	//
	// So this is the first Source for which Report.Complete is true. Both
	// predicates now say something a caller can act on: a clean document validated
	// against this rule set is Conformant, and it is Complete, because everything
	// left is a rule a reference validator does not evaluate either. Every other
	// Source still names a fatal gap it could close and has not.

	// XRechnung. Every identifier KoSIT publishes in its own Schematron is now
	// evaluated: BR-DE-1..11, 14..22, 23-a/b, 24-a/b, 25-a/b, 26..28, 30, 31, the
	// seven BR-DE-CVD-*, the fifteen BR-DEX-*, BR-DE-TMP-32, BR-TMP-2, BR-TMP-3
	// and BR-TMP-CVD-01. That is 57 and not the 54 this table used to claim: the
	// harness that counted them read <assert ...> with a regular expression that
	// stops at the first '>', and three of KoSIT's assertions carry a '>' inside
	// an attribute value — BR-DE-19 and BR-DE-20 in their IBAN arithmetic
	// ("if($cp > 64)") and BR-DEX-02 in "count(cac:SubInvoiceLine) > 0". They were
	// invisible to every check that read the flags, which is also how BR-DEX-02
	// came to be filed as fatal when KoSIT flags it warning.
	//
	// What was left was not KoSIT's own rules but the ones it imports, and those
	// are evaluated now: the 21 Peppol BIS Billing rules src/xsl/rule-list.xml
	// whitelists and src/xsl/peppol-into-xr.xsl merges into the released artefact,
	// in KoSIT's wording of them and gated on that file. So SourceXRechnung is
	// absent from this table, which is the claim that its rule set — all 78
	// identifiers of the Schematron a German buyer validates against — is evaluated
	// in full. completeSources in report_test.go is where that claim is registered.
	//
	// The imported findings carry SourcePeppol, because Source names the authority
	// that wrote the rule and OpenPEPPOL wrote these. They are nonetheless
	// XRechnung's coverage and not Peppol's, and the distinction is not a dodge: the
	// Sources a validator hands newReport name *the rule sets that ran*, and the
	// rule set that ran is XRechnung's, which happens to include 21 rules of
	// OpenPEPPOL's authorship. ValidateXRechnung therefore does not declare
	// SourcePeppol, and a caller reading an XRechnung Report's NotEvaluated is told
	// what the XRechnung Schematron leaves unchecked rather than what OpenPEPPOL
	// publishes and KoSIT never imported — which is most of Peppol's rule set,
	// including every PEPPOL-COMMON-* identifier and all 101 country-specific rules.
	// Both tables are empty now, so the two coverage answers coincide; the
	// distinction is still the one that decides which Sources a validator declares.

	// Peppol BIS Billing 3.0. All 59 PEPPOL-COMMON-* and PEPPOL-EN16931-*
	// identifiers the vendored Schematron publishes are evaluated — 58 in the UBL
	// binding, 44 in the CII one, each in the binding that publishes it.
	//
	// The count used to read "60", and both halves of that number were wrong. It
	// counted PEPPOL-COMMON-R048, which is inside an XML comment in both binding
	// files and is therefore a rule OpenPEPPOL withdrew rather than a gap; and it
	// counted PEPPOL-EN16931-R045, which no binding publishes at all — the entry
	// wrote the family as "R040..R046" and the artefact has no R045 in the
	// PEPPOL-EN16931 series. The severity test could not catch either, because it
	// skips an identifier the artefact does not carry.
	//
	// The other rule set in the same two files is evaluated too. PEPPOL-EN16931-UBL.sch
	// and -CII.sch each carry, after the PEPPOL-* patterns and under a comment
	// reading "National rules", the country-specific rules OpenPEPPOL publishes for
	// eight member states — 101 identifiers, of which the UBL binding holds all 101
	// and the CII binding 41, for 142 (identifier, binding) pairs. No survey of this
	// rule set in this repository had counted them, this table included, because
	// every one of them matched on the prefix "PEPPOL-" and stopped.
	//
	// They belong here rather than behind an option, and the artefacts say so three
	// times over: neither binding file declares a <phase>, so ISO Schematron
	// activates every pattern; buildconfig.xml's base configurations are the whole
	// file with no phase attribute; and each rule is gated inside itself on the
	// supplier's country, and the domestic ones on the customer's too, so evaluating
	// them unconditionally accuses nobody. peppol_country_rules.go sets out the five
	// different spellings of that gate, which are not interchangeable.
	//
	// They are not the NLCIUS or CIUS-BE rule sets under their own Sources: NL-R-*
	// here is OpenPEPPOL's Dutch rule set, distinct from the BR-NL-* of
	// SourceNLCIUS, and DE-R-* is OpenPEPPOL's German set, distinct from KoSIT's
	// BR-DE-*. And KoSIT imports none of the 101, so an XRechnung validation does not
	// acquire them — which matters most for the German family, since OpenPEPPOL's
	// DE-R-NNN is a re-publication of KoSIT's BR-DE-NNN and reporting both would name
	// one defect twice.
	//
	// SourcePeppol is therefore absent from this table, which is the claim that its
	// rule set — all 160 identifiers of the two files, in the bindings that publish
	// them — is evaluated in full. completeSources in report_test.go is where that
	// claim is registered, and TestEveryPublishedPeppolRuleHasBothVerdicts is what
	// holds it up: every one of the 244 published (identifier, binding) pairs has a
	// document that trips it and one that does not.

	// NLCIUS is finished in both halves and in both bindings — 34 identifiers in
	// UBL, 33 in CII — and it was the last rule set in this package whose only gap
	// was advisory. Its "not recommended" tier is evaluated now, as warnings, so a
	// Dutch invoice reports Complete() as well as Conformant().
	//
	// The gap that entry used to describe read "BR-NL-19..35", which is a range and
	// not a set: SI-UBL publishes no BR-NL-22, -23 or -34 at all, and its BR-NL-27,
	// -28 and -32 exist only as numbered sub-rules (BR-NL-27-1 … -4).
	//
	// What is left is four identifiers neither authority's own validator can report,
	// all for the same reason and all derived from the artefacts rather than argued:
	// a rule whose context an earlier rule of the same pattern has already claimed is
	// never reached, because ISO Schematron processes a node with the first matching
	// rule and no other. TestNLCIUSUnevaluableRulesAreDerivedFromTheArtefacts
	// re-derives all four.
	//
	// BR-NL-9 is the consequential one and it is per binding rather than per rule
	// set: it is evaluated for a UBL document, where SI-UBL binds it in the same
	// Schematron rule as BR-NL-7 and BR-NL-8, and it is unevaluable for a CII one,
	// where the NLCIUS-CII file gives it a rule of its own against a context BR-NL-7's
	// rule already holds. This package reported it for CII until that was read.
	//
	// One entry here is not Unevaluable and it is the newest: SI-UBL-2 in the UBL
	// binding and empty-element-check in the CII one, which are one rule published
	// under two names. It was found by the enumeration guard PR 28 built — the same
	// guard that surfaced the eight BR-GA-* rules of the G-account extension, which
	// *are* evaluated now — and until that guard existed no survey of this rule set
	// had counted it, because every one of them matched on the prefix "BR-NL-" and
	// stopped. That is C39's defect, in a second authority's artefact.
	//
	// It is named rather than evaluated, and the reason is a property of the rule
	// rather than of the work. It is the only rule in either binding that carries no
	// gate: every BR-NL rule is inside $si ("this document declares the NLCIUS
	// specification identifier") or $s ("$si and the supplier is Dutch"), and this
	// one is inside neither, so a faithful implementation would report on documents
	// ValidateNLCIUS has deliberately decided to say nothing about — see
	// nlciusApplies, where that decision is argued. Evaluating it inside $si instead
	// would be reporting less than the authority does under a rule of this package's
	// own invention. Either choice is a change to what ValidateNLCIUS means for a
	// non-NLCIUS document, which is a decision of its own and not a side effect of
	// implementing an extension.
	//
	// Naming it costs Complete(), which was true for a Dutch invoice and is now
	// false. That is a correction and not a regression: the claim rested on a survey
	// that had never seen this rule.
