// Factur-X / ZUGFeRD as a rule set of its own.
//
// # Why this file exists
//
// EN 16931 is a semantic model plus, per syntax, a normative binding: CEN
// publishes EN16931-CII-syntax.sch, 583 CII-SR-* and CII-DT-* assertions that
// hold a CrossIndustryInvoice down to the core subset of CII the standard defines
// — "only a preceding invoice reference may carry an issue date", "an amount
// other than the VAT total shall not carry a @currencyID". A CIUS that says
// nothing about the binding inherits CEN's, and most do: KoSIT's released
// XRechnung Schematron and OpenPEPPOL's BIS Billing both include CEN's CII
// validation file outright.
//
// Factur-X does not. FNFE-MPE and FeRD publish five profile Schematrons —
// MINIMUM, BASIC WL, BASIC, EN 16931, EXTENDED — and between them they carry
// four of CEN's 583 binding assertions: CII-SR-463, CII-SR-464, CII-SR-465 and
// CII-SR-466 in every profile from BASIC WL up, plus CII-DT-097 in EXTENDED. In
// their place each profile carries a data model of its own, which the next
// section describes.
//
// Applying CEN's binding to a Factur-X document is therefore applying a rule set
// its authority did not adopt, and the two disagree exactly where it matters. The
// EXTENDED profile exists to carry terms the EN 16931 core subset of CII does not
// have; CEN's binding is written to reject precisely those. Measured over the 59
// examples FNFE-MPE publishes with the specification, validating each at the
// profile its own BT-24 declares: 13 conforming EXTENDED invoices drew 76 fatal
// findings — CII-DT-027 seventy times, CII-DT-021 three, CII-DT-018 twice,
// CII-SR-439 once — every one of them naming a rule Factur-X does not impose, and
// FNFE's own validation reports for those same documents record
// isValidBusinessRules = true. That is issue #56, and this file is the fix.
//
// # What Factur-X publishes instead, and what of it is here
//
// Two mechanical facts about these Schematrons are worth stating before anything
// else, because both defeat the way the rest of this package reads an artefact.
//
// First, a Factur-X assertion carries no id attribute. A rule is identified by an
// "[ID]-" prefix on its message text, so an enumeration written the way CEN's,
// KoSIT's and OpenPEPPOL's are written finds zero identifiers here.
//
// Second, most assertions have no identifier at all: 51 of 107 in MINIMUM, and
// 1,241 of 1,458 in EXTENDED. They are not stray. They are a generated,
// per-profile *data model* — one assertion per element of the profile's element
// table — and they come in six mechanical shapes, which between them decide
// exactly the questions CEN's CII-SR-*/CII-DT-* rules decide:
//
//	count(X)=n, count(X)<=n, count(X)>=n   "Element 'X' must occur exactly n times"
//	report true()                          "Element 'X' is marked as not used in the given context"
//	assert @a                              "Attribute '@a' is required in this context"
//	report @a                              "Attribute @a' marked as not used in the given context"
//	assert string-length($cv)=0 or         "Value of 'X' is not allowed" — a lookup in an
//	  document('..._codedb.xml')/...       external code database the bundle ships beside the .sch
//
// That layer is where the disagreement lives. CEN's CII-DT-027 forbids
// ram:FormattedIssueDateTime on every document reference but the preceding
// invoice; Factur-X's EN 16931 profile forbids it on ram:AdditionalReferencedDocument
// with type code 50, 130 and 916 by name, and its EXTENDED profile permits it there.
// Same question, per-profile answer.
//
// This package does not evaluate that layer. Coverage(SourceFacturX) counts it,
// by profile and by shape, and says so; it is the honest gap, and it is the
// reason Report.Conformant is false for every Validate call. What is here is:
//
//   - the CEN-minted binding assertions Factur-X does carry, in facturXBinding
//     below, reported under SourceEN16931 because CEN minted the identifier, the
//     condition and the wording — Factur-X quotes them, which
//     TestFacturXQuotesCENsConditionVerbatim checks assertion by assertion;
//   - the nine BR-FXEXT-* rules that are Factur-X's own new ground, reported
//     under SourceFacturX.
//
// # Which BR-FXEXT-* are here, and why the other 42 are not
//
// EXTENDED publishes 50 BR-FXEXT-* identifiers and MINIMUM one more, 51 in all.
// They split cleanly in two, and the split is the reason this file implements a
// subset rather than an arbitrary sample:
//
//   - 42 are restatements of CEN identifiers the EXTENDED profile drops.
//     EXTENDED omits 41 of the identifiers the EN 16931 profile publishes —
//     BR-22/23/24/26/38/44, BR-CO-04/10/11/12/13/15/16, BR-S-08/09, BR-AE-08,
//     BR-E-08, BR-G-08, BR-IC-08, BR-Z-08 and the rest — and puts back a looser
//     variant of most of them, one that carves out the sub-line structure
//     (LineStatusReasonCode = DETAIL / GROUP) EXTENDED adds. BR-FXEXT-BR-22 is
//     BR-22 restricted to lines whose subtype is DETAIL or absent.
//
//     This package keeps CEN's stricter original and does not evaluate the
//     replacement. That follows the decision recorded for CIUS-PT, whose copy of
//     CEN's Schematron omits 192 identifiers this package still reports: an
//     authority's omission of a CEN identifier is recorded, not acted on, because
//     the alternative is a false negative wherever the replacement is looser and
//     there is no replacement at all. Coverage(SourceFacturX) names them, and
//     facturXCENOmissions records the omission itself.
//
//   - 9 are Factur-X's own new ground — the BT-X-* extension terms, the sub-line
//     structure, the date format qualifier 205 CEN's binding never had a rule for.
//     Those are implemented here.
//
// # Severity
//
// Factur-X flags 21 of its assertions warning and leaves the rest unflagged, so
// within this artefact the absence of a flag is evidence rather than a default:
// an unflagged BR-FXEXT-* rule is fatal, and the two that carry flag="warning"
// among the nine implemented here — BR-FXEXT-04 — are warnings.
//
// The CEN-minted assertions are different, and they are reported at CEN's flag,
// not at Factur-X's absent one. CII-SR-463 and CII-DT-097 are fatal in
// EN16931-CII-syntax.sch and CII-SR-464/465/466 are warnings there, and that is
// how they come back from here. The reason is D7's: severity is a quotation of a
// published flag and never an inference, and for these five identifiers there is a
// published flag — CEN's. Reading Factur-X's absent attribute as "fatal" for a rule
// CEN flags warning would be this package deciding a severity, which is what C29
// found it doing to seven XRechnung rules. The consequence is stated rather than
// hidden: a Factur-X processor rejects a document for CII-SR-465 and this package
// warns. Coverage(SourceFacturX) records it.
//
// # Rule order
//
// The five Schematrons each hold one large pattern carrying the data model — 34
// rules in MINIMUM, 901 in EXTENDED — and one single-rule pattern per business
// rule. Under ISO Schematron a node goes to the first matching rule in a pattern
// only, so order matters inside the large one and nowhere else.
//
// Of the assertions implemented here, CII-SR-465 and CII-SR-466 sit in the large
// pattern (on ram:ApplicableHeaderTradeAgreement) and everything else is in a
// pattern of its own. TestFacturXRulesAreReachableInTheirPattern re-derives that
// from the artefact: for every implemented assertion it checks that no earlier
// rule in the same pattern can claim its context nodes. This is the fourth
// distinct place ISO rule ordering has decided something in this package (C42),
// and the first where checking it was cheap because the artefact's contexts are
// absolute paths.

// ciiBinding names whose CII syntax binding a validation applies.
//
// It is a separate axis from Profile because the two are independent facts: which
// tier of Factur-X's data model a document claims, and whose binding it is judged
// by. Eight callers in this package pass ciiBindingCEN — the CIUS whose published
// artefacts include CEN's EN16931-CII-validation — and only Validate passes
// ciiBindingFacturX.
