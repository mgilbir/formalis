// Package formalis validates electronic invoices against the EN 16931 semantic
// model, the Core Invoice Usage Specifications (CIUS) layered on top of it, and
// the national invoice formats that stand outside EN 16931 altogether. It uses
// nothing but the Go standard library.
//
// One syntax-neutral rule engine (fed by parseEN16931) serves both EN 16931
// syntaxes — UN/CEFACT Cross Industry Invoice (CII, used by Factur-X/ZUGFeRD)
// and OASIS UBL (Peppol BIS, XRechnung UBL, NLCIUS) — and each CIUS adds its own
// rule layer in its own file (xrechnung.go, peppol.go, nlcius.go, cius_pt.go,
// cius_ro.go, cius_be.go, cius_rs.go). The formats that are not EN 16931
// profiles at all — FatturaPA, Facturae, ebInterface, KSeF, Finvoice, TEAPPS,
// OIOUBL, Svefaktura, ZATCA, NAV OSA, UBL-TR, PINT — and the Order-X order
// document are checked against their own mandatory structure and code lists by
// validators of their own. Source names every one of these authorities, and a
// rule is identified by the pair (Source, Rule) rather than by Rule alone.
//
// # Entry points
//
// Every exported validator takes a context and the document's bytes and returns
// a Report and an error. Which one to call:
//
//   - Detect routes. It reports which format a document is in, in one streaming
//     pass that builds no tree, and Detection.Validator returns the entry point
//     that checks it.
//   - ValidateCIUS applies that same arbitration and validates in one call,
//     falling back to the EN 16931 core for a document that declares nothing.
//   - Validate checks a document as Factur-X, at a named Profile: the EN 16931
//     core, the rules that tier is expected to satisfy, and the syntax binding
//     FNFE-MPE publishes for it rather than CEN's. It is for a caller who has that
//     data-richness metadata from a container the invoice itself does not carry.
//   - ValidateEN16931 checks it as CEN's own EN 16931, with CEN's binding and no
//     Factur-X rule. It takes no Profile, because CEN publishes none.
//   - The format-specific validators (ValidateXRechnung, ValidateZATCA, …) are
//     the direct route when the format is already known.
//
// The twelve Is* predicates answer "is this document format X?" for one format
// each. They are independent tests and not a partition — more than one can be
// true of the same bytes — so route with Detect, which arbitrates between them
// in an order it documents.
//
// # The four answers a validator can give
//
// The distinctions this package exists for are all in how a call can end, so they
// are worth reading once:
//
//   - An error, with the zero Report: the input could not be read at all —
//     malformed XML, an encoding this package does not implement. A statement
//     about the file. See ErrMalformedXML and ErrUnsupportedEncoding.
//   - A Report holding a RuleLimit finding: the run stopped before it had seen
//     everything, so nothing can be concluded. A statement about the run, and
//     never an empty Violations slice. See RuleLimit and IsCheckerViolation.
//   - A Report holding findings: the document departs from rules that were
//     evaluated. Each carries the Severity its authority gave the rule, so
//     Report.Fatal and Report.Warnings separate "reject this" from "note this".
//   - A Report holding no findings: everything that was evaluated passed. What was
//     evaluated is the other half of the answer, and Report.NotEvaluated is where
//     it is written down.
//
// No rule set in this package evaluates everything its authority publishes: each
// is a documented subset. Coverage names the gaps for any Source, with the
// severity of each and whether anyone could evaluate it at all, and it takes no
// document, so a caller can ask what a validator will not look at before deciding
// to call it. Report.NotEvaluated repeats those gaps for the run that just
// happened; Report.Conformant is false whenever a rule that could have rejected
// this document was one a validator could have evaluated and this package did not,
// and Report.Complete whenever any evaluable rule went unevaluated. Today CEN's
// EN 16931 core is the one rule set with no unevaluated fatal rule and the one
// whose clean documents report both Conformant and Complete — reached by
// ValidateEN16931, or by ValidateCIUS on a document declaring no profile at all.
// Validate reports Conformant and not Complete, and every national format
// validator still names a fatal gap it could close and so reports false whatever
// the document.
//
// Validate spent two releases in that last group deliberately. It reported
// Conformant for a clean Factur-X document while it was judging one by CEN's CII
// syntax binding, which Factur-X does not adopt — 76 fatal findings on 13 of
// FNFE-MPE's own 59 published examples — so scoping the binding correctly made
// the answer false until Factur-X's own rule set was evaluated in its place. It
// is now: the per-profile data model, between 48 and 1,241 assertions a tier, and
// the 33 BR-FXEXT-* rules that are fatal, nine of them Factur-X's own new ground
// and 24 restatements of a CEN identifier the profile drops. What is left under
// SourceFacturX is advisory or unevaluable, which is why Conformant is true again
// and Complete is not.
//
// The distinction the third field carries is worth one sentence here, because it
// is what makes Complete answerable rather than permanently false: CEN publishes
// seven rules that no validator can evaluate — four bound to the XPath expression
// true(), three unreachable in CEN's own Schematron rule ordering — and a rule
// nobody can check is not a rule this package skipped. See RuleFamily.Unevaluable,
// which documents how narrow that is, Report and Coverage.
//
// Three rule sets report warnings, and every other finding in this package is
// fatal. CEN flags 1,168 of its two syntax bindings' assertions warning rather
// than fatal — the UBL-CR-*, UBL-DT-*, CII-SR-* and CII-DT-* rules that hold a
// document down to the EN 16931 core subset of UBL and CII — and this package
// evaluates all of them from tables generated out of CEN's own Schematron. KoSIT
// flags eleven of XRechnung's fifty-seven rules warning or information: the
// invoice type code, the specification identifier, the two IBAN checks, the
// telephone and email formats and five more. OpenPEPPOL flags six of its
// fifty-nine warning — the Italian, Danish and Swedish participant-identifier
// format checks — and one more, PEPPOL-EN16931-R120, is fatal in OpenPEPPOL's own
// Schematron and warning in the XRechnung artefact that merges it, so the same
// rule is a non-conformance on one path and advisory on the other. None of these
// is a verdict: a document whose only findings are these is Conformant, and a
// caller gating on Report.Fatal never sees them. See Severity and
// Report.Warnings.
//
// # Concurrency
//
// There is no global mutable state. The code-list tables, the compiled regexps
// and the generated syntax-binding tables (parsed once at load by
// en16931_syntax_advisory.go)
// are package-level values initialised once at load and only read afterwards,
// and every per-call artefact — the run, the parsed tree, the semantic model —
// is allocated inside the call. Every exported function may therefore be called
// from any number of goroutines at once; TestValidatorsAreSafeForConcurrentUse
// pins that under -race.
//
// # A note on pdf0, which this package's comments refer to
//
// This package reads XML and has no PDF dependency. pdf0
// (github.com/mgilbir/pdf0) is a separate, public sibling module that wraps it
// for the Factur-X container: pdf0 opens the PDF, extracts the attached invoice
// XML, and calls in here. The dependency runs one way — pdf0 requires formalis,
// and nothing in this module imports or needs pdf0 — so the references to it in
// limits.go, orderx.go and facturx_en16931.go are design constraints, not
// dependencies.
// They record conventions the two modules deliberately share, RuleLimit above
// all, so that a caller draining one mixed slice of container and invoice
// findings has one name to look for rather than two. A reader with no interest
// in PDF containers can disregard every one of them; nothing here changes
// behaviour because of pdf0.

// Profile is a Factur-X/ZUGFeRD conformance profile: how much of the EN 16931
// semantic model a document undertakes to carry, in increasing data richness.
// The five values below are the whole set, and Profile means only this. It is
// not a rule set chosen by nationality: a Core Invoice Usage Specification is a
// separate concept carried by CIUS, reached through ValidateCIUS or a
// CIUS-specific validator such as ValidateXRechnung.
//
// Keeping the two apart is what makes the type checkable. While XRechnung was
// also a Profile constant it was accepted by Validate and applied no BR-DE-*
// rule, so the call that looked most like "validate this as XRechnung" was the
// one that validated it least; and because any string was accepted, a
// mistyped profile was silently read as EN 16931. Validate now reports a
// Profile it does not implement — see RuleProfile.
//
// # A Profile selects a rule set, and not only an excuse list
//
// Naming a Profile says "judge this document as Factur-X". Two things follow.
//
// The first is the excuse list, which is all a Profile used to be, and it is
// unchanged: MINIMUM and BASIC WL are head-only, so the invoice-line rules
// (BR-12, BR-16) are not applied to them; MINIMUM additionally omits the buyer
// postal address (BR-10, BR-11), the VAT breakdown (BR-CO-18) and the amount-due
// summation (BR-CO-16); and EXTENDED is exempt from the allowance/charge total
// summations (BR-CO-11, BR-CO-12), whose operands it may carry unitemized.
// TestProfilesThatDifferStillDiffer pins each of those differences.
//
// The second is which syntax binding a CII document is held to, and it is why
// this type is no longer only an excuse list. Factur-X publishes a CII binding of
// its own and does not adopt CEN's: the five profile Schematrons carry four of
// CEN's 583 CII-SR-*/CII-DT-* assertions, and in their place a per-profile data
// model of their own. Applying CEN's binding to a Factur-X document applies a rule
// set whose purpose is to hold a document down to the EN 16931 core subset of CII
// to a document whose profile exists to carry more than that subset — measured over
// FNFE's own 59 published examples, 13 conforming EXTENDED invoices were reported
// with 76 fatal findings naming rules Factur-X does not impose. So a Profile now
// selects Factur-X's binding, and EXTENDED additionally brings in 33 BR-FXEXT-*
// rules that are Factur-X's own — nine that are new ground and 24 that restate a
// CEN identifier EXTENDED drops — while MINIMUM brings in one more, BR-FXEXT-G-08.
// Those are the second way the named rule sets differ between tiers, alongside
// BR-CO-11 and BR-CO-12 above; the third is that 21 of those 24 restatements
// *supersede* the CEN identifier they restate, so EXTENDED can be silent on a CEN
// rule whose Factur-X replacement is satisfied.
// TestBasicEN16931AndExtendedDifferOnlyInTheRulesEXTENDEDPublishes pins that the
// list is exhaustive. See Validate, SourceFacturX and facturx_restatements.go.
//
// That data model is the larger half of what a Profile now decides, and it is
// where the five tiers differ most. It is one assertion per element of that
// tier's element table — 48 in MINIMUM, 196 in BASIC WL, 262 in BASIC, 412 in
// EN 16931, 1,241 in EXTENDED — and the answers are genuinely per tier: MINIMUM
// does not use the buyer postal address at all, the EN 16931 tier forbids a
// formatted issue date on a document reference by type code, and EXTENDED permits
// it. So the same document is not conformant at every tier, and it is not meant to
// be: a Profile names the tier a document *claims*, and the tier's element table
// is what that claim is worth. facturx_datamodel.go evaluates it and
// TestFacturXTiersDifferInTheirDataModel measures the difference.
//
// A caller who wants CEN's own EN 16931 verdict, with CEN's binding and no
// Factur-X rule at all, calls ValidateEN16931, which takes no Profile because CEN
// publishes none.

// Source identifies the authority that defines a rule, so that a rule identifier

//
// The distinction is not decorative. This package reports identifiers minted by
// CEN, by seven national bodies, and by itself, in one flat string field, and
// they have already collided: the Order-X validator once emitted "BR-O-01" for
// "an Order shall have an order number" while the EN 16931 rule engine emitted
// "BR-O-01" for the "Not subject to VAT" category family. A caller aggregating
// findings across a mailbox keyed by Rule merged two unrelated defects, and a
// suppression list ("we accept BR-O-03 from this supplier") suppressed the wrong
// thing in the other document type. Scoping every finding by its author makes
// that class of mistake impossible to express.
//
// Three judgement calls are recorded here because they are not obvious:
//
//   - The UBL and CII syntax-binding rules (UBL-DT-*, UBL-SR-*, CII-SR-*,
//     CII-DT-*) carry
//     SourceEN16931, not a Source of their own. Source names the *authority*, and
//     CEN publishes the bindings (EN 16931-3-2, EN 16931-3-3) as normative parts
//     of the same standard as the semantic model (EN 16931-1); they arrive in the
//     same conformance artefacts this package is tested against, and the FP=0
//     oracle counts them among the rules it must catch. Splitting them would also
//     make one finding's Source depend on the invoice's syntax, since the same
//     defect — two disagreeing payment means codes — is UBL-SR-47 on a UBL
//     invoice and CII-SR-467 on a CII one, which is a distinction the caller did
//     not ask for. A caller that does want
//     "syntax binding" separately has the prefix, which is already disjoint from
//     the core BR-* space.
//
//   - RuleLimit, RuleProfile and RuleRoot carry SourceChecker. They are statements
//     by this checker — "I stopped early", "you named a profile I do not
//     implement", "this is not an invoice" — rather than by any rule authority, so
//     attributing them to CEN would be a lie, and leaving them unattributed would
//     make Source unusable as a filter. See IsCheckerViolation for why that
//     predicate still tests Rule alone. A document this package could not read at
//     all produces no finding under any Source: it is an error, because there is
//     no document to attribute anything about.
//
//   - Most national formats below (FatturaPA, Facturae, ebInterface, KSeF,
//     Finvoice, TEAPPS, OIOUBL, Svefaktura, ZATCA, NAV OSA, UBL-TR, PINT,
//     Order-X) do not publish a rule identifier this package could quote, so the
//     identifiers under those Sources — "FPA-number", "ZA-uuid", "ORDER-01" —
//     were invented here. The Source is still the format they judge the document
//     against, which is what a caller routing or suppressing by format needs; it
//     is not a claim that the format's own documentation uses these names. The
//     Sources whose identifiers *are* quoted from a published rule set are
//     EN 16931, Factur-X, XRechnung, Peppol, NLCIUS, CIUS-PT, CIUS-RO, UBL.BE and
//     SRBDT.

// flag="fatal" or flag="warning" on every assertion, and the national
// authorities quoted here do the same (KoSIT adds flag="information", which is
// advisory under another name). This type carries that flag folded onto two
// values, because two is what a caller can act on: a fatal finding is a reason
// to refuse an invoice and a warning is not.
//
// The same assertion can carry different flags in the two EN 16931 syntax
// bindings — BR-51 is fatal in the CII binding and a warning in the UBL one —
// so severity belongs on the finding, where the binding that produced it is
// known, rather than on a table keyed by rule identifier.
//
// # Why SeverityFatal is the zero value
//
// An unstamped Severity reads as fatal, deliberately. The two orderings are not
// symmetric. With SeverityWarning at zero, an emission site that forgot the
// field would report a genuine non-conformance as advisory: Report.Conformant
// would pass over it, Report.Fatal would omit it, and an invoice would ship on
// the strength of a field nobody set. With SeverityFatal at zero the same
// omission over-reports — a caller sees a blocking finding for an advisory rule,
// notices, and the stamp gets fixed. This package exists to keep silence from
// being read as a clean invoice, so the default has to lean the other way.
//
// The default is not a substitute for deciding, and it is not left unchecked:
// TestOnlyTheAdvisoryBindingsAreEmittedAsWarnings sweeps the whole corpus and
// fails on any finding whose severity does not match the half of the package it
// came from, and TestEveryEmittedEN16931RuleCarriesCENsFlag holds the one Source
// with vendored ground truth to the flag CEN publishes — in both directions, so
// an advisory rule stamped fatal by the zero value fails as loudly as a fatal one
// stamped advisory.
//
// # This package's own rule identifiers
//
// Most national formats publish no rule identifier this package could quote, so
// the identifiers under those Sources — FPA-*, FE-*, EB-*, KS-*, FI-*, ZA-*,
// SV-*, TP-*, OIO-*, TR-*, HU-*, PINT-*, ORDER-* — were minted here (see
// Source). No authority has flagged them, so their severity is a decision rather
// than a quotation, and the decision is that all of them are fatal.
//
// The reason is what those rules check rather than who wrote them down. Each is a
// mandatory element of the format's own schema or a value outside its own code
// list, so a document that breaks one is a document the authority's gateway
// rejects at the border: the SdI refuses a FatturaPA with no invoice number, and
// Fatoora refuses a ZATCA invoice with no UUID. That is precisely what fatal
// means here. If one of these formats is later found to publish a genuinely
// advisory expectation and this package implements it, it belongs at
// SeverityWarning and TestOnlyTheAdvisoryBindingsAreEmittedAsWarnings is where
// the change gets recorded.
//
// # SourceChecker findings
//
// RuleLimit, RuleProfile and RuleRoot are this package's statements about its
// own run or about the file it was handed, so no authority has flagged them and
// severity is this package's classification rather than a quotation. They are
// fatal, for the reason above rather than by analogy: a caller who writes
// len(r.Fatal()) == 0 as their release gate must not have a cancelled run, a
// rejected Profile or a document that is not an invoice slip through it. A third
// value for "not a rule" was considered and rejected — it would make Fatal and
// Warnings no longer a partition of Violations, and every caller who switched on
// severity would have to invent a policy for the third case, most of them
// choosing the unsafe one. The distinction those callers actually need is
// already exported, precisely and tested: IsCheckerViolation.

// severity is a per-identifier lookup with a test that reads the flags back out of
// the Schematron. peppolEval.add, in peppol_rules.go, is the fourth and the only one
