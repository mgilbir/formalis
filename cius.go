// This file holds the one place this package reads the Specification identifier
// (BT-24, the UBL CustomizationID or the CII
// GuidelineSpecifiedDocumentContextParameter/ID) and says which rule set it
// names, and the entry point that validates a document against whatever that
// turns out to be. Callers that do not know which profile an invoice targets can
// use ValidateCIUS and let the document route itself.
//
// # Why the table below exists
//
// Every test in it is a substring of a namespaced identifier, and substrings of
// namespaced identifiers nest: "urn:peppol:pint:billing-1@my-1" contains
// "peppol". Written as an unordered set of independent tests, the routing is
// therefore ambiguous, and the ambiguity is not theoretical — it shipped. A
// switch whose last case was strings.Contains(id, "peppol") sent all 64 PINT
// sample instances in the corpus to the Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 validator, which
// opens by requiring BT-24 to be the BIS identifier a PINT invoice by definition
// does not carry (C24).
//
// So the tests are a single ordered list rather than a switch, ordered most
// specific first, and everything that has to make this decision reads that one
// list:
//
//   - DetectCIUS reports the CIUS an identifier declares;
//   - specIDSource reports the rule set it names, including the three that are
//     not CIUS (PINT, OIOUBL, UBL-TR);
//   - declaresSpecID answers the unordered question — "does this identifier
//     carry that profile's discriminator" — which is what the Is* predicates
//     ask, since each of them is documented as an independent test rather than
//     as a branch of a partition;
//   - route, in detect.go, applies it inside the wider arbitration Detect
//     documents, and validateCIUS below routes on the result.
//
// Two orderings that can disagree is how C24 happened. There is now one.

// CIUS identifies a Core Invoice Usage Specification the dispatcher recognises.
