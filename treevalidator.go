import "context"

// The validators in this package come in two shapes. The EN 16931 half — the
// core rule engine and the CIUS layered on it — parses a document onto the
// syntax-neutral semantic model and runs one rule engine over it, so UBL and CII
// are read by the same rules. The national formats below it have no such model:
// FatturaPA, Facturae, ebInterface, KSeF, Finvoice, TEAPPS, OIOUBL, Svefaktura,
// ZATCA, NAV OSA, UBL-TR, PINT and Order-X are each their own vocabulary, and
// each is checked by walking the parsed element tree directly.
//
// This file is the harness for that second half. Thirteen files were writing out
// the same five steps — parse, route a parse failure, check the root, build the
// finding sink, wrap the result — and one of the thirteen drifted off the
// contract limits.go states as a property of the whole package. ValidateOrderXML
// answered a parse error with a finding of its own rather than with
// syntaxViolation, so malformed XML, empty input and a perfectly well-formed
// CrossIndustryInvoice all came back as the single claim "the order XML is not a
// well-formed Cross Industry Order": false about the third document, silent
// about *where* the first one broke, and invisible to a caller filtering on
// RuleSyntax to tell a bad file from a bad invoice.
//
// The point of the harness is therefore not brevity but that there is now one
// path from bytes to findings for every one of these validators, and it goes
// through syntaxViolation. A national file can no longer express the divergence,
// because it no longer contains the code that diverged.

// treeValidator is one format's tree-reading validator: the roots it accepts,
// what it says about a document whose root it does not accept, and its rule
// body. Every field is required.

	// source is the authority stamped on every finding this validator emits,
	// including the wrong-root one.

	// rootRule and rootMsg are the finding for a well-formed document that is not
	// of this format. It is deliberately not RuleSyntax: such a document may be
	// impeccable XML and a valid invoice in some other format, so reporting it as
	// malformed would be an accusation the parser never made. Each format names
	// it in its own space (FPA-root, FE-root, ZA-root, ...) so that a caller can
	// tell "I was handed the wrong document" apart from "this document is
	// broken", which is the distinction C5 collapsed.

	// genuinely differ here and so keep their own predicates: several share UBL's
	// Invoice root and are told apart by a child only they have (ebInterface's
	// Biller, Svefaktura's UBL-1.0 SellerParty), and two accept a second root
	// (ZATCA and PINT also read a CreditNote).

	// check is the rule body — everything this format has to say about a document
	// it accepts. It is reached only with a root that accepts returned true for,

	// Source is fixed at the point of emission.

// once, route a parse failure through syntaxViolation, refuse a root this format
// does not describe, then run the rule body.

// Every exit is wrapped in r.finish, so the invariant that a stopped run never
// returns an empty slice holds on all four of them, and the single parse per
// exported call that makes maxNodes a property of the document rather than of
// the entry point is preserved: nothing below here reads the bytes again.
//
// Every exit is also wrapped in newReport under this format's own Source, so
// the coverage claim is the same on all four: these validators check the
// mandatory structure and code lists rather than the whole XSD their authority
// publishes, and that is true of a document they refused as much as of one they
// read to the end.

// and re-reading the bytes to build another would charge one document's element
// budget twice — the failure TestNodeBudgetIsPerDocumentNotPerEntryPoint exists
// to prevent. Both callers therefore run the same body over the same root, and a
